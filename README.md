### Introduction (Revision) of the Working Principal of Web Pages
Web pages are generally wriiten in HTML, when the web page is loaded in a browser,the browser takes this html code
and produces a tree like structure called the DOM (Document Object Model), this can then be manipulated by javascript
in response to the user actions.

For example, we can use javascript to hide a button when it is clicked, 
this is vanilla javascript (plain  javascript code without any 3rd party code)

### React Intro
In React, the webpage is built using components, the components are the basic building block used by the user,
essentially, all reacts apps are made up of components in a tree structure with the App component being the root.
